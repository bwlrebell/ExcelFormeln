## Project Description

One of my first projects, where I tipped my toes into Web Development. 

In my day jobs, I regularly get to maintain Excel Files from colleagues. Some of these files have messy nested Excel formulas, where it’s very difficult to understand what these formulas are doing. Therefore, I decided to code an Excel formula prettifier and ideally, develop the project into a small business or sell it as an Excel Add-on. 

However, my ideas were way above my head and skill level, so after a working demo, I stopped the project. 


## Technologies

- **Svelte** SPA Framework (before Sapper and SvelteKit)
- **Sass CSS** for styling
- Embedding the app into a static page
- **Tests** in software engineering
- Small sprinkles of **TypeScript**
